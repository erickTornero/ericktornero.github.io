I am Interested in Deep Learning Research, especially feel enthusiastic about research in Deep Reinforcement Learning and Robotics. Currently, I am currently working as part of my master's thesis, about whether a quadrotor can learn a policy that allows it to fly and that is robust to the total loss of a rotor.
